            <p>1. POST Section – This is where user posts will appear. Posts can consist of images, text, emojis, stickers, or other options. There will also be a separate section for the most liked posts.</p>

            <p>3. Advanced Analytics Page with Graphs.</p>
            <p>4. Friend Request System</p>
            <p>5. Medals and Badges System</p>
            <p>6. Complete Profile Edit Option with features to resize logos or banners for a perfect fit, and options for animated logos and banners</p>
            <p>7. Top Leaderboard Advance</p>
            <p>8. Moderator Panel – Allows regular users to help manage the website.</p>
            <p>9. Report Button</p>
            <p>10. Custom CSS animations will be added to make the website smoother, along with skeleton loading to ensure the page looks seamless while data is loading</p>
            <p>11. Rework the entire website's UI/UX and backend to make it more secure. Some features, like live wallpapers and animated logos, won't be possible due to their larger file sizes compared to static images. I will implement technology to compress images to optimize storage. As the free plan offers only 512MB of database RAM and 1GB for wallpapers, storage is limited.</p>
